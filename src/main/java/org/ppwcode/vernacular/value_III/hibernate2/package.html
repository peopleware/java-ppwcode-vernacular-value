<p>Support to make the implementation of Hibernate 2 {@link net.sf.hibernate.UserType UserTypes}
  easy for value types that follow our value vernacular.</p>
<p>To persist objects emulating values using Hibernate, they have to be mapped to columns in a
  {@link java.sql.PreparedStatement SQL update query} and from columns in a
  {@link java.sql.ResultSet SQL result set}. In Hibernate 2, this is done through
  {@link net.sf.hibernate.UserType UserTypes}, which have to be registered in the Hibernate config files.
  <!-- TODO add more descriptive text or a reference how exactly -->
  This package adds support to make the implementation of such {@link net.sf.hibernate.UserType UserTypes}
  easy for value types that follow our value vernacular, at least up to a point.</p>
<p>Note that, since Hibernate 2 is an older version of Hibernate, this package is to be considered legacy.
  It is not further developed. More support can be found in other packages for more recent versions of
  Hibernate.</p>
