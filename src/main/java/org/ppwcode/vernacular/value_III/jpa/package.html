<p>Support to make the implementation of JPA easy for value types that follow our value vernacular.</p>
<p>JPA does support dealing with custom value types in 2 ways: without any intervention, data of custom
  types is stored in the database as the BLOB that results from serialization of the value instance.
  Optionally, a custom value type can be defined <dfn>embeddable</dfn>, via annotations or xml declarative
  definitions. For the latter, we need the value type to be a JavaBean, and thus a {@link org.ppwcode.vernacular.value_III.MutableValue},
  which we rather not do in many cases. Sadly, neither approach suffices for the needs we perceive in our projects.</p>
<p>Both OpenJPA and Hibernate, 2 JPA implementations one can use, define extra features. For controlling
  how custom value types are persisted, in Hibernate, we can use <dfn>user types</dfn>. The equivalen concept in
  OpenJPA are <dfn>value handlers</dfn>.</p>
