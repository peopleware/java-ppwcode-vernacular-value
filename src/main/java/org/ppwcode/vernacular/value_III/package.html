<p>This package contains guidelines for implementing value type classes. General
  things are defined in class <a href="Value.html"><code>Value</code></a>,
  <a href="MutableValue.htmm"><code>MutableValue</code></a>,
  <a href="ImmutableValue.html"><code>ImmutableValue</code></a> and
  <a href="EnumerationValue.html"><code>EnumerationValue</code></a>. Each value type
  should implement one of these interfaces, or be a Java <code>enum</code>.</p>
<p>This package offers abstract classes that can be used as superclasses for value type
  implementations, that implement as much of the contract of values as possible.</p>
<p>Exceptions thrown in the context of value types should be or extend
  <a href="SemanticValueException.html><code>SemanticValueException</code></a>.</p>
<p>General code for dealing with values is gathered in <a href="ValueHelpers.html"><code>ValueHelpers</code></a>
  and <a href="EnumHelpers.html"><code>EnumHelpers</code></a>.</p>
<h3>Peripheral code</h3>
<p>For each value type you define, you need extra code that interacts with the
  context and framework you use in periphery. In a web application, you need code
  to transfor a value object to and from a String representation that can be
  carried in a HTTP request and response. In a desktop application, you need a way
  to edit properties of objects of value type. When object properties of a value type
  need to be persisted using a persistence technology, we need to explain to the
  technology how to do that. In the case of SQL-based persistent storage, we need
  to map the value type to SQL primitives. The code to do this is to be considered
  part of the definition of the value type, and should be offered in classes next
  to the value type. We expect that support is offered for the technologies the creator
  of a new value type uses at the moment of creation, and further support to be added
  when other people use the value type in other contexts. As such a value library
  will continuously ameliorate.</p><p>This package offers general support for the implementation of such peripheral
  interaction code for value types for</p>
<ul>
  <li>JPA (<a href="jpa/package.html"><code>org.ppwcode.vernacular.value_N.jpa</code></a>)</li>
  <li>Hibernate 2 and 3
    (user types, see <a href="hibernate2/package.html"><code>org.ppwcode.vernacular.value_N.hibernate2</code></a>
    and <a href="hibernate3/package.html"><code>org.ppwcode.vernacular.value_N.hibernate3</code></a>)</li>
  <li>OpenJPA (value handlers, see <a href="openjpa/package.html"><code>org.ppwcode.vernacular.value_N.openjpa</code></a>)</li>
  <li>web applications (configuration code, see <a href="web/package.html"><code>org.ppwcode.vernacular.value_N.web</code></a>)</li>
  <li>JSF (converters and components, <em>not reactivated yet &mdash; this code can be found in the jsf
    project that is still in the purgatory</em>)</li>
  <li>dwr (converters, <em>coming</em>)</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>For simple value types, the interaction with the periphery most often revolves around transforming
  a value instance to and from a programmatic String representation of that value. There are many
  different frameworks around to do this, that all basically to the same thing. We have choosen for
  simple types always to implement a standard Java SE {@link java.beans.PropertyEditor}. For all the
  other peripheral technologies we than have an implementation of user types, value handlers,
  converters and the likes that delegate transformation to an appropriate {@link java.beans.PropertyEditor}
  instance for the given value type. This essentially makes it possible for simple value types that
  have a String programmatic representation to be able to perform in any supported peripheral context
  when we only have to program an appropriate {@link java.beans.PropertyEditor}, or even only have
  to code the value type according to patterns explained in the interfaces for value types.</p>

<p>For more complex value types, we need separate code for each peripheral technology, or a more ad hoc
  generalization is to be created.</p>
