    <section name="Getting Started with PPW Test">
      <p>
        This document (as well as the others in this section) provide
        an introduction to PPW Test and how to use it within a project.
      </p>

      <p>
        To avoid overwhelming you (user, developer, or contributor) with
        unnecessary information, this document attempts to provide
        references to various documents depending upon your Maven
        interests.  It is meant to provide you with a starting point
        that can be effectively used to get to the information you need
        without going through all of the documentation on the site,
        which might be a little overwhelming.
      </p>

              Before you can start using PPW Test in any form, you'll have
              to download the PPW Test distribution to your system (unless
              you plan on building PPW Test from source).  This document
              provides links to the various distributions available.
